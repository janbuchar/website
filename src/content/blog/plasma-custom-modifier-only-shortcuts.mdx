The latest release of KDE Plasma (5.8) brought a new feature - it can open the
desktop menu when the meta (super, Windows...) key is pressed. Like in Windows
XP, remember? Alas, it's not yet possible to configure this to do something more
useful in the GUI, however weird this seems in a LTS release. After digging in
KWin's source code for a while, I found a way to set custom shortcuts in the
config files.

First, make sure KWin isn't running. I recommend opening a terminal and running
`killall kwin_x11`. Now let's say we'd like to open krunner when Meta is pressed
and the desktop menu should be opened with Shift. Edit `~/.config/kwinrc` and
add the following lines:

```ini
[ModifierOnlyShortcuts]
Meta=org.kde.krunner,/App,,display
Shift=org.kde.plasmashell,/PlasmaShell,org.kde.PlasmaShell,activateLauncherMenu
Alt=
Control=
```

The double comma in the `Meta` value is not a typo. It means something like that
the called function is not in a namespace, in contrast to the function in the
`Shift` value. An empty value means no action will be bound to the modifier.

Now, you just need to run KWin again with `kwin_x11 --replace` and everything
should work. Note that it should be possible to bind any qdbus call to a
modifier key like this. Try using `qdbusviewer` to explore the possibilites!

**Update (June 2024)**: Since Plasma 6.1 has been released, you can configure 
modifier-only shortcuts in the system settings, just like any other shortcut.
