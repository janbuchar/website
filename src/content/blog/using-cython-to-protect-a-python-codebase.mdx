Recently, I worked on a Python project that required the whole codebase to be
protected using Cython. Although protecting Python sources from reverse
engineering seems like a futile task at first, cythonizing all the code leads to
a reasonable amount of security (the binary is very difficult to disassemble,
but it's still possible to e.g. monkey patch parts of the program).

This security comes with a price though - the primary use case for Cython is
writing compiled extensions that can easily interface with Python code.
Therefore, the support for non-trivial module/package structures is rather
limited and we have to do some extra work to achieve the desired results.

---

The first obstacle we had to overcome was that it's difficult to compile a whole
Python package (as in "directory containing an `__init__.py` file") with Cython.
Imagine the following structure:

```plaintext
src
├── mypkg
│   ├── bar.py
│   ├── foo.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── mypkg2
│   ├── bar.py
│   ├── foo.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── setup.py
```

The recommended way of cythonizing this would be using a `setup.py` file such as
this:

```python
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools.extension import Extension

from Cython.Build import cythonize
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

setup(
    name="mypkg",
    ext_modules=cythonize(
        [
           Extension("mypkg.*", ["mypkg/*.py"]),
           Extension("mypkg2.*", ["mypkg2/*.py"])
        ],
        build_dir="build",
        compiler_directives=dict(
	    always_allow_keywords=True
        )),
    cmdclass=dict(
        build_ext=build_ext
    ),
    packages=["mypkg", "mypkg2"]
)
```

The `setup.py` is more or less what you would expect from a project that uses
Cython. There are two things to be noted though. First, the
`always_allow_keywords` directive makes it possible for Flask view functions to
work correctly by disabling an optimization that only allows keyword arguments
for functions with a lot of parameters. Second, we do not use the `ext_package`
parameter suggested by some guides, which would put the cythonized code into
another package. By omitting it, the compiled code is kept in the same place.

However, after we build our project with `python setup.py build_ext`, we notice
that the resulting package cannot be imported - it is missing an `__init__.py`
file. There is `__init__.so` that can be imported from Python, but that isn't
enough to make a directory a package in Python's eyes. Not being able to import
the package is not the only problem - code inside it cannot perform
package-relative imports (e.g. `from .foo import foo`) either, which breaks its
functionality.

To remedy this problem, we can copy the `__init__.py` file from our source tree
after the rest of the project is built. A good way to do so is overriding the
`build_ext` class in `setup.py`:

```python
# ...

from pathlib import Path
import shutil

# ...

class MyBuildExt(build_ext):
    def run(self):
        build_ext.run(self)

        build_dir = Path(self.build_lib)
        root_dir = Path(__file__).parent

        target_dir = build_dir if not self.inplace else root_dir

        self.copy_file(Path('mypkg') / '__init__.py', root_dir, target_dir)
        self.copy_file(Path('mypkg2') / '__init__.py', root_dir, target_dir)
        self.copy_file(Path('mypkg') / '__main__.py', root_dir, target_dir)
        self.copy_file(Path('mypkg2') / '__main__.py', root_dir, target_dir)

    def copy_file(self, path, source_dir, destination_dir):
        if not (source_dir / path).exists():
            return

        shutil.copyfile(str(source_dir / path), str(destination_dir / path))

setup(
# ...
    cmdclass=dict(
        build_ext=MyBuildExt
    ),
# ...
)
```

We have successfully created Python packages that can be imported from. They
reside under `build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.6` or something similar. Sadly, this is
not enough for the distribution of our package. Ideally, we'd like to have an
installable package that only contains compiled code. The current standard for
Python archives is the wheel format (.whl), which aims to replace the .egg
format. So, let's try to create a wheel with `python setup.py bdist_wheel`!
After the command finishes, there should be a `dist` folder that contains a
wheel file. Unpacking it yields something like this:

```plaintext
.
├── mypkg
│   ├── bar.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   ├── bar.py
│   ├── foo.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   ├── foo.py
│   ├── __init__.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   └── __init__.py
├── mypkg-0.0.0.dist-info
│   ├── DESCRIPTION.rst
│   ├── METADATA
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── RECORD
│   ├── top_level.txt
│   └── WHEEL
└── mypkg2
    ├── bar.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    ├── bar.py
    ├── foo.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    ├── foo.py
    ├── __init__.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    └── __init__.py
```

Apparently, the archive contains not only compiled code, but also the sources.
There is a way to fix this, however counter-intuitive it might seem. We need to
remove our packages from the `packages` argument of the `setup` call. This way,
the extensions will still be built and included in the wheel, but the source
code will not.

```python
setup(
    # ...
    packages=[]
)

```

The content of the built wheel should then look like this:

```plaintext
dist/
├── mypkg
│   ├── bar.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   ├── foo.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   ├── __init__.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
│   └── __init__.py
├── mypkg-0.0.0.dist-info
│   ├── DESCRIPTION.rst
│   ├── METADATA
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── RECORD
│   ├── top_level.txt
│   └── WHEEL
└── mypkg2
    ├── bar.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    ├── foo.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    ├── __init__.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    └── __init__.py
```

The wheel can be installed with `pip install dist/*.whl`. If we do not need to
inspect the wheel or distribute it manually, we can just run `pip install .` in
the project directory, which builds the wheel and installs it for us.

It is also possible to strip Python source code from .egg archives, but it
involves overriding the `bdist_egg` command from `setuptools`. I won't cover
that here, but if you're interested, check out the `--exclude-source-files`
option and the `zap_pyfiles` method of aforementioned command class.

By following this guide, you should be able to cythonize a Python codebase with
non-trivial package/module structure, thus making it difficult for evil hackers
to reverse engineer it and steal your programming know-how.
